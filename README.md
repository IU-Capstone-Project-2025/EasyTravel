# EasyTravel: POI Search & Recommendation System

EasyTravel is an intelligent web application for fast semantic search and personalized recommendations of points of interest (POIs) and attractions based on user interests and free-text queries.

## 📌 Value Proposition

EasyTravel helps users discover places and experiences tailored to their preferences by combining semantic vector search with personalized interest tags.

```

* **Backend**: implements authentication, user/profile management, search and recommendation endpoints.
* **Frontend**: user interface (handled by a separate team).
* **DLS**: handles data preprocessing, embedding generation (LaBSE), FAISS index building and search.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, OAuth2/JWT, Docker
* **Search Engine**: FAISS (IVF-PQ), LaBSE sentence embeddings (Sentence-Transformers)
* **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
* **Containerization**: Docker, docker-compose

## 🖥️ Prerequisites

1. **FAISS index file**  
   We keep the heavy `poi_ivfpq.poi_ivfpq` on Google Drive rather than in Git.  
    download all files
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QCts-pkFMKhGErPVhY9i7WJI4ihmvG3f?usp=sharing
2. Copy to DIR like:
   - LaBSE_emb.npy -> /DLS/experiments/indexes/LaBSE_emb.npy
   - MiniLM-6-L12_emb.npy ->/DLS/experiments/indexes/MiniLM-6-L12_emb.npy
   - MiniLM-12-L6_emb.npy -> /DLS/experiments/indexes/MiniLM-12-L6_emb.npy
   - poi_embeddings.npy -> /DLS/Embeddings/poi_embeddings.npy

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Launch with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will start the FastAPI backend on port **8000** and a PostgreSQL database.

## 📈 Experiments & Metrics

All search & recommendation experiments, benchmarking scripts, and results are under `DLS/experiments`. Key insights:

* **Embedding model**: LaBSE (768-dim)
* **FAISS parameters**: `NLIST=128`, `nprobe=50`, `expand_k=1000`
* **Best precision**: precision\@5 = **0.837**, precision\@10 = **0.759**

## 🔗 Documentation

* **Backend API**: [Backend/README.md](Backend/README.md)
* **Search Engine & Data**: [DLS/README.md](DLS/README.md)
* **Frontend**: [Frontend/README.md](Frontend/README.md)

## 🎯 Next Steps

* Enhance personalization using search history and collaborative filtering.
* Scale to more cities and POI categories.
* Optimize indexing (quantization, HNSW, etc.) for faster latency.
